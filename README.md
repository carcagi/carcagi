I have been a software developer for more time than I can remember. Not only that, but I have led teams of all sizes, I've delivered software for small businesses and big sharks. Ever since the beginning of my career, I have enjoyed the entire software development process from idea to execution.

I consider myself an eternal learner, and I love learning new things, even if it's just for fun, this allowed me to open my mind and have a lot of "hello world" programs in different programming languages. Also, I have learned how to communicate effectively with my teammates and the stakeholders, how to gather requirements, and how to stay on time and budget.

Through the years I have come to develop using a variety of tools, some people call this collection of tools/knowledge "the stack".

- PHP, Python (Web, ML, DS), JavaScript, C, C++, Scala.
- APIs with Microservices and FaaS (functions as a Service) or Serverless.
- OOP and Functional programming.
- Clean software and architecture.
- Relational and non-relational Databases. (MySQL, SQLite, MariaDB, Postgres, MongoDB, Redis)
- SCRUM and Kanban as Agile Methodologies. Experience with XP.
- Experience as Project Manager, Scrum Master, and Technical Leader.

I am interested in Machine Learning and Blockchain Development.
